The following are instruction pertaining to the CSS. Please note that all CSS files are found in the folder, "stylesheet":

## Header and Footer

The CSS for the header and footer is called style.css. This should NOT be edited and must be added to each HTML page with a header tag. 

The format is: <link rel="stylesheet" href="../stylesheet/style.css"> 

In your html file, remember to include the footer link. However, at this moment, there is not styling for it.

## Creating the CSS files for each page

We decided to create the CSS files fo each page but remember that styling found in the style.css should not be repeated in each sheet.
